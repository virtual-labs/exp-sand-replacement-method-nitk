8. Place the sand pouring cylinder on a glass plate. Now, click on the knob to open the shutter for sand to fill in the conical portion and then close it. Click on the sand retained on the glass plate to measure the weight of the sand filled in conical shape. Note down the weight of sand in the conical portion and calculate the weight of the sand portion without the cone portion.<br>
