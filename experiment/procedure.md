11. Click on the trowel to excavate the circular hole on the ground which is of equal volume to that of the calibrating container. <br>
<img src="images/17.png"><br>

12. Click on the knob of the sand pouring cylinder and allow the sand to fill the excavated hole in ground.  <br>
<img src="images/20.png"><br>

13. Click on the sand pouring cylinder to measure the weight of sand remaining on the cylinder after pouring it into the excavated hole.<br>
<img src="images/20.png"><br>

14.  Click on the sand pouring cylinder to measure the weight of sand remaining on the cylinder after pouring it into the excavated hole.<br>
<img src="images/19.png"><br>

15. Click on the tray to measure the weight of soil excavated from ground and note down the reading.  Enter the calculated value of bulk density of soil. Then click on "Check" and "Result" to check the result.<br>
<img src="images/27.png"><br>

16. Click on the empty cylinder to measure the weight and note down the reading.<br>
<img src="images/22.png"><br>

17. Click on the trowel to fill the soil into a cylinder.<br>
<img src="images/23.png"><br>

18. Click on the cylinder filled with soil to place it on the weighing machine and note down the weight.<br>
<img src="images/26.png"><br>

19. Click on the container removed from the oven to place it on the weighing machine and note down the reading.<br>
<img src="images/25.png"><br><br>
<img src="images/26.png"><br>

20. Calculate the dry density of soil and enter the value. Click on "Check" and "Result" to check the correct answer. Then inference will be displayed. <br>
