      "explanations": {
        "a": "This option is not in order where the cylinder is placed over the tray in the first step.",
        "b": "This option is in the correct order where the tray is placed over the ground in the first step, then a test hole is dug ,then place the cylinder over the tray and open the cylinder valve.",
        "c": "This option is not in order where the test hole is dug in the first step. Tray has to be placed on the ground in the first step.",
        "d": "This option is not in order where the first step is correct. In the second step a hole is dug for the test, which is incorrect."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The answer is wrong. Formula to calculate density = mass/volume.",
        "b": "Formula to calculate density = mass/volume = 1500/ 1000 = 1.5g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Hence correct.",
        "c": "The answer is wrong. Formula to calculate density = mass/volume.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "A floating body is said to be in equilibrium condition, if the body returns back to its original condition after applying angular displacement.",
        "b": "The force that retards the moving sphere through a viscous fluid is directly proportional to the velocity, radius of the sphere and viscosity.",
        "c": "This principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.",
        "d": "The rate of flow of liquid through a soil  medium of unit cross sectional area is directly proportional  to hydraulic gradient."
